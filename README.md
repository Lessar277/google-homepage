Version 0.9 
- finished adding content

Version 1.0

Version 1.0.1 
- Fixed a bug where the two buttons beneath the search bar were not centered.

Version 1.0.3 
- Updated the Google logo with the new 2015 Logo Doodle

Version 1.0.4 
- Added 'placeholder' for searchbox

Version 1.1  
 - Fixed a bug where the outline of the searchbox would not appear in IE or Firefox;
 - Fixed a bug where text in the searchbox would scroll behind microphone icon;
 - Removed ugly box-shadow from the buttons below searchbox. Now they look closer to their original versions from the actual Google Homepage;
 - Replaced the Google Doodle animation with the new static Google logo;
 - Got rid of the searchbox outline and added jQuery code for the box border to change color on input (previously, if one looked close enough, one could see there were two actual borders, one on top of the other).
            
Version 1.1.1 
- In the previous version, the added jQuery code broke the hover border over the searchbox. This is now fixed;
- Added extra padding to searchbox to make it look more like the original.
